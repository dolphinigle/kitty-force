Please mkdir bin and mkdir old.
old will house the past codes of past contests.

At the end of a contest, you should clean up by executing the save script:
sh save.sh <name_of_contest>

It will create a folder with the contest name inside old repository,
move everything there, and refresh all cc files.

Please name input and output files as .in and .out, respectively.

Have a good day.
