Setup:
Please create directories bin/ and old/ in the source code directory.
old/ will house the past codes of past contests, while bin/ will house
the executables.

Next, please read the docs in main.cc. It covers usage as well.

At the end of a contest, you should clean up by executing the save script:
sh save.sh <name_of_contest>. It will create a folder with the
contest name inside old repository,
move everything there, and refresh all cc files.

Please name input and output files as .in and .out, respectively.

Have a good day.
